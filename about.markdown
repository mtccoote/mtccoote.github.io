Talk Education Partnership (TEP) is a [charity](https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search/-/charity-details/5087129/governing-document) that works with local partners in Uganda to improve education and health in rural primary schools. 

The communities we serve in Uganda experience high rates of poverty and water stress; schools in these rural areas often lack   infrastructure to provide safe water, resources to educate effectively and training to support teachers' professional development. 

Our partnership model means that we always work with local people, [our partners]({% link partners.markdown %}). Infrastructure, resources and training we provide are commited to the ownership of the schools they benefit. 

TEP is run in compliance with the UK charity law by our [trustees]({% link governance.html %}). Read our [posts]({% link index.markdown %}) to find out about our latest activities.
