## Talk Education Uganda (TEU)
Since 2018, TEU has been a focal point for Talk Education Partnership's activities in rural Uganda. 

The directors of TEU are Lovisa, Lydia and Francis.

In June 2022, TEU completed a development project to build 3000l water tanks at three primary schools. Together TEP and TEU identified suppliers, made funding available to complete works and designed contracts and policies to deliver resilient infrastructure in primary schools at Perper, Pajwenda and P'okongo Rock.
