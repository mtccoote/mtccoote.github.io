Welcome to Talk Education Partnership's (TEP's) new website!

This site emerged from an initiative to minimise the charity's operating costs. It has allowed TEP to cut subcriptions to website-building services and to streamline its domain name service (DNS) providers. 

Ongoing costs for TEP's online presence have __fallen by over 80%__ as a result. This leaves us with more money to spend on [our causes]({% link about.markdown %}), and means more of your donations go toward those causes.

The flipside was that I had to learn how to build and maintain a working website. Fortunately, static website generators deal with all the difficult bits. 

I used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for the structure of the site, leaving only a couple of cosmetic styling tweaks and the addition of third party tools. With a secure donations platform from [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) and a contact form by [Formspree](https://formspree.io/), the site was ready to go online.

This website is deployed through [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), using a custom domain from the newly streamlined DNS provider. 

This site is still a minimum viable product (MVP). If you have any tips to share, resources it could use or even an interest in developing more sophisticated tools for TEP's online presence, please [get in touch]({% link contact.html %}).
